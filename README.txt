Say hello to Multiverse, a slick, one-page gallery design with a fully functional lightbox
(courtesy of my Poptrox plugin for jQuery) and a custom, reusable "panel" system (click the
"About" button in the lower right to see what I mean). Had a ton of fun putting this one
together, and I hope you have as much fun working with it :)
